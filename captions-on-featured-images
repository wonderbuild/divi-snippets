Captions on Featured Images


1. Open the single.php file from your child theme
2. Paste the following code before the first closing et_post_meta_wrapper div.  
You need to make sure you put it at the end of the first one, just before the <div class=”entry-content”> area:

<div class="et_post_meta_wrapper">
...
<?php if (get_post(get_post_thumbnail_id())->post_excerpt) { // search for if the image has caption added on it ?>
	<div class="featured-image-caption">
		<?php echo wp_kses_post(get_post(get_post_thumbnail_id())->post_excerpt); // displays the image caption ?>
	</div>
<?php } ?>

</div> <!-- .et_post_meta_wrapper -->

3. Make sure to add your caption to the image in your media library

4. You can then style the caption by targeting the “featured-image-caption” class.
